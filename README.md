# Math Score Linear Regression
This model uses Linear Regression to predict the math scores of students of a particular school.
The dataset I used can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams

The assumptions I made when building this model are as follows
  * The parents' level of education has an impact on the upbringing of a the student
  * The lunch type of the student somehow reflects the family's financial situation. For instance, if a student is on a free/reduced meal plan, I assumed that the student cannot afford paying the regular price for the meal plan.
